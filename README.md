# Decision-Tree

We have data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and Drug y.

Our goal is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The feature sets of this dataset are Age, Gender, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol of patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.
